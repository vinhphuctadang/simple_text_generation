# simple_text_generation

Simple neural network implemented to generate text
Simply run train.py without any params to train a pre-structured neural network in order to generate a paragraph of words
### myTok.py is used to convert from raw to trainable data
## Not it is perfect, but it is enough for study about deeplearning, predominantly, LSTM
